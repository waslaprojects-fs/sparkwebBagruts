SparkWeb (sparkwebBagruts) — Deployment Process (Firebase Hosting)

What this repo deploys to
- Hosting target: Firebase Hosting project "sparkbagrut" (from .firebaserc)
- What gets deployed: the "dist/" folder (from firebase.json -> hosting.public)
- SPA routing: all routes rewrite to /index.html (from firebase.json rewrites)

1) Prerequisites (one-time)
- Install Node.js (LTS recommended).
- Install project dependencies (choose ONE):
  - Using npm:
    npm ci
  - Or using pnpm:
    pnpm install

Note: This repo includes firebase-tools in devDependencies, so you can use it via npx firebase ...

2) Login to Firebase (one-time per machine/user)
- Run:
  npm run firebase:login
- This opens a browser to authenticate.

3) Confirm you are deploying to the correct project
- Default Firebase project: sparkbagrut (in .firebaserc)
- Optional verification:
  npx firebase projects:list
  npx firebase use

4) Build the website (every deploy)
- Run:
  npm run build
- This generates a fresh production build into dist/.

5) (Recommended) Test locally before deploying
- Preview the production build:
  npm run serve
- Or run Firebase Hosting emulator:
  npx firebase emulators:start --only hosting
- Then open:
  http://localhost:5000

5.5) Push and deploy (full workflow)
- Push your changes to Git:
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
- Then build and deploy (see step 6 below).

6) Deploy to Firebase Hosting


Option B (explicit commands):
  npm run build
  npx firebase deploy --only hosting

7) Verify after deploy
- Open your Firebase Hosting URL (from the deploy output).
- Check key pages/routes (SPA rewrite should make direct URL refresh work).

8) Common issues & fixes
- Deploy shows old content: rebuild first (npm run build), then deploy again.
- Wrong project: run `npx firebase use sparkbagrut` then deploy.
- Routing 404 on refresh: this repo already has SPA rewrite to /index.html in firebase.json.
